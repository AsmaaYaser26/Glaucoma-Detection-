# Glaucoma Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a binary classification model for Glaucoma detection using Deep Learning techniques.

## Project Description

Glaucoma is a serious eye disease that can lead to irreversible vision loss if not detected early. This project aims to leverage the power of Deep Learning to detect Glaucoma from eye images, which can greatly assist in early detection and treatment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of eye images labeled as ‘Glaucoma’ or ‘Healthy’.

## Model and Evaluation 
This project used TensorFlow Sequential layers to build a neural network.
The acheived accuracy was:97%.
