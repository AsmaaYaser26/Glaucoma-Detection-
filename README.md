# Glaucoma-Detection
Deep learning project 

## Description 
Glaucoma is a common eye condition where the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain, becomes damaged and can cause sight loss. So, this project will do:
Early Detection Of Glaucoma Using Deep Learning. Fundus images are used gor this problem. A fundus image which is an ocular documentation that records the appearance of a patientâ€™s retina and optic nerve.
Data augmentation is done to increase the number of images to be trained and by result enhancing the model performance.
The binary classification is done using a built neural network (model) using tensorflow layers.
The acheived test accuracy is 99%.
